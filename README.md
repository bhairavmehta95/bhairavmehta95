I am the founder and CEO of [q&ai](https://qandai.org), a platform to enable faster, stronger, and smarter customer-facing teams. Previously, I was a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying deep and multi-task learning. I have a Masters in Deep Learning from [Mila](http://mila.quebec/), and a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. Before q&ai, I worked as a research intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NVIDIA's Seattle Robotics Lab. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhairav-mehta/) is the most up-to-date, but you may also be looking for my old [academic site](https://bhairavmehta95.github.io/) or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uPtOmHcAAAAJ).
