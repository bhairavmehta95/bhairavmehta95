Nowadays, I'm building in the cross-section of generative ai + business workflows, whatever that means.

Previously, I was the founder and CEO of [Buzzle](https://buzzle.ai), a YC-backed platform to help strategic teams get more out of their call recording libraries. I was a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying the effect of data distributions on deep learning and multi-task learning algorithms. I have a Masters in Deep Learning from [Mila](http://mila.quebec/), and a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. Before q&ai, I worked as a research intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NVIDIA's Seattle Robotics Lab. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhairav-mehta/) is the most up-to-date, but you may also be looking for my old [academic site](https://bhairavmehta95.github.io/) or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uPtOmHcAAAAJ).
